<h1>Lifting Lights</h1>

A small project I'm doing to learn the tkinter module in Python<br>

<h3>About</h3>
This is a small project I'm doing for fun to learn more about the Tkinter module in Python. 
In python, Tkinter is the standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package, it is the most 
commonly used one. Seeing as how I have other programming ideas that I want to do that may
require this module, so I figured I would do this little project. 

<h3>What is this for?</h3>
If you're unfamiliar with the sport of powerlifting or weightlifting in general, both sports
require a contestant to lift certain lifts according to certain rules. In powerlifting, the 
lifts are the squat, bench, and deadlift and in weightlifting its the snatch and clean and jerk.
If a lift succeeds, then the contestant is awarded 3 white lights. If not, then they get 
red lights. Sometimes a combination of red and white lights are awarded. A lift passes 
if there are 2 or more white lights. 
<br>
<br>
<b>As of right now, I have only figured out how to get all three circles to be red and white, as 
time goes on I hope to figure out how to make it have 2 red lights, 2 white lights, etc.</b>

<h3>How Do I run/use this?</h3>
You will need:<br>
<ul>
<li>Python 3</li>
</ul>

<h4>How to run</h4>
<ol>
<li>First, install Python if you don't have it already. :)</li>
<li>Next, use the command <b>git clone</b> to clone this repo</li>
<li>Next, Change your current working directory to whereever you downloaded it, 
if it was in download then use the command in the command line to go <b>cd donwload</b>
if it was in the desktop use <cd>cd desktop</b></li>
<li>Next in order to run it use <b>python *whatevernameyousavedas*.py</b></li>
</ol>
